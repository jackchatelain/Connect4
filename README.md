# Connect4-Python

(The original readme was translated to English with DeepL)

This project consists of two main components:

* src: which contains the implementation of the game and the agents (robots)
* content: which contains all the teaching material on the subject.

The entire implementation was done in Python. This project is a fork of Keith Galli's project. Some modifications have been made to the implementation, mainly to allow robot-on-robot play.

All the teaching material is new.

The license for this project is MIT License, as can be seen in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file in the repository. In other words, you can use all the material for any purpose you like. However, it is necessary to cite the authors of this project.

## Setup

To set up the project, I recommend creating a virtual environment:

````bash
python3.9 -m virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Running the mkdocs server on the local machine

To run the documentation server on a local machine just type:

````bash
cd content
mkdocs serve
````

## Deploying documentation using github actions

There is a `main.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` directory that defines the deployment of documentation on github's gh-pages using actions.

## Examples of running the Liga4 or Connect4 game

The game can be initialized in a few ways via `src/connect4.py` or `src/connect4_with_ai.py`:

* `src/connect4.py`: two players playing manually.
* `src/connect4_with_ai.py`: one manual player and one artificial player.
* `python connect4_with_ai.py random`: the artificial player behaves randomly.
* `python connect4_with_ai.py minmax 5`: the artificial player implements the min-max algorithm. The number entered is the depth that the min-max algorithm will consider - it must be a value greater than or equal to 1.

* `python connect4_with_ai.py flat`: is equivalent to running minmax at depth 1. It is used to show the behavior of an agent that only evaluates the first level of the tree.

* `python connect4_with_ai.py complete`: is equivalent to running minmax at depth 20. It is used to show the behavior of an agent that evaluates the entire search tree.

* `python connect4_ai_versus_ai.py random 0 minmax 5`: the first argument defines the first player. If it is `random` then the second argument can be any value. The third argument defines the second player. If the player is `minmax` then the subsequent argument must always be the depth adopted by `minmax`.


## Compile the slides

To view the files in the slides folder or generate `pdf` from them, just use any Markdown plugin in VSCode.
